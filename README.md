## Quick Start

You can use [myddd starter](https://starter.myddd.org) to create a myddd-vertx project just in seconds.

To get more details about myddd starter, please visit the website and try it yourself.

## Why myddd-vertx

myddd has already created a Java-based DDD framework - myddd-spring-boot. So why does myddd still create another backend DDD framework?

Because we want to create a more simple and clean performance framework for backend development.

There are some reasons for this:
  * Kotin is known as `better-java`, it's simple and clean than Java.
  * Vert.x is a reactive toolkit for Java and supports Kotlin, Use Reactive is more performance.

## The core principles

myddd-vertx obeys these principles.
  * Reactive style development
  * Based on Kotlin and Vert.x

If you do not families with the Kotlin and Vert.x, you can still consider myddd-spring-boot which is based on Java and Spring Boot.
